# fb-navbar-ts

Typescript version of fireship.io's [facebook navbar](https://github.com/fireship-io/229-multi-level-dropdown) tutorial.

The goal of this repo is to improve upon the example by porting it to typescript, and making it truly reusable, as the original only animates up to 1 nested dropdown item.

## Setup & run

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn start`
